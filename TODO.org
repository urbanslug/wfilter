** TODO Solve incorrect interval computation in ~index::compute_match_intervals~
So far the computing where the matches are seems to be off by a few bases I'm not sure why. For example in an a alignment for a:
  - query running from ~41052~ to ~324759~ I find that the last interval is underestimated to end at ~324730~.
  - target running from ~0~ to ~283680~ I find that the last interval is also underestimated ~283624~.
